**Nurturing a Sacred Worship Space:** Suggest for our experienced leaders to avoid much disco lights and to abstain from worldly-style concerts that emphasize emotional gratification. For our veteran sisters, let modesty guide their dress choices, favoring dresses that echo reverence. For our longstanding brothers, I suggest selecting attire that is more fitting than shorts, aligning with the occasion's importance.

**Preparing Your Heart for Worship:** 
Embrace Repentance, Confession, Forgiveness, and Cleansing before Presenting Yourself to the Lord.

**Empowering Others in Spreading the Good News**
Encouraging Inclusive Learning and Sharing
Let's let others share their opinions on topics like Sunday School, so that they can expand their knowledge and learn to convey the Good News to others as well. Let's teach them to learn and utilize the Lord's guidance in spreading the good news. Let's not allow only leaders or teachers to have the knowledge to proclaim the Good News of salvation. Invite others to read the Bible in order to have the knowledge to share the Good News.

**Fostering Compassion Across Churches**
Following the Footsteps of Jesus and the Apostles in Acts of Assistance
Church extending help to those in need, much like Jesus and the Apostles did. It highlights the compassionate nature of the Church by addressing the needs of the less fortunate, particularly widows and widowers. The act of providing assistance is carried out with humility, with the sole intention of bringing glory to our Lord and Savior.

**Anonymous Giving for Generous Hearts**
 A Guideline Inspired by Jesus's Teachings
As Lord Jesus said, "Give assistance to others, for only God knows." When offering financial help to our fellow brethren within the Church, consider the example of placing the assistance in an envelope. Specify the recipient's name without indicating the source of the aid. This envelope can then be securely placed into the Offering Box.

**Serve GOD with HOLINESS and RIGHTEOUSNESS.**
