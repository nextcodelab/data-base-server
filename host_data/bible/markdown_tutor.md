**Lord Jesus Christ** gave up ***Glorious Heaven***, ***His Throne***,  ***Comfort***, ***Majesty***, ***Kingdom***, ***Heavenly*** ***Glory and His  Divine wholeness***  to come and walk on this filthy earth *to die for humanity*.
Just to get you  back to His arms again.

Of all His creations, you are the sole bearer of His image and likeness. You are His inheritance even to His authority that He can give to you.[Genesis 1:27](Gen 1:27)

His mind and heart is full of excitement, and tears of joy when He designed you and knit you together to form you into a being. And there is no single moment that He have taken His eyes away from you, you are very important to **HIM**.[Psalm 139:13-16](Ps 139:13-16)
