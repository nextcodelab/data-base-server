**1.** Suggestions for our church leaders, it is good to minimize disco like lights in church gathering. For our veteran sisters, good suggestion are modesty apparel dress choices, favoring dresses that echo reverence. For our longstanding brothers, I suggest selecting attire that is more appropriate than shorts, aligning with the occasion's significance ***[1 Timothy 2:9-10](1 Timothy 2:9-10), [Romans 12:2](Romans 12:2), [1 Pedro 3:3-4](1Pet 3:3-4) [Isaiah 3:16-23](Isa 3:16-23) (1 John 2:16)[1John 2:16] (Revelation 17:4)[Rev 17:4]***.

**2.** 
Embrace Repentance, Confession, Forgiveness, and Cleansing before Presenting Ourselves to the Lord [Matthew 5:23-24](Matthew 5:23-24).

**3.**
Promote learning and sharing by allowing others to express their opinions on topics such, as Bible study, meetings or fellowships. This will enable them to expand their knowledge and effectively convey the Good News to others. Lets teach them how to seek and apply the guidance of the Lord when spreading the Good News; it shouldn't be limited to leaders or teachers who have this knowledge. Encourage others to engage in reading the Bible so they can acquire the knowledge to share the Gospel ***[Colossians 3:16-17](Col 3:16-17)***.

### PLEASE ENCOURAGE MEMBERS, THAT THEY CAN ALSO SHARE THE GOSPEL TO OTHERS FOR THE SALVATION (ETERNAL INVESTMENT) FOR ETERNITY. JESUS IS COMING; LET'S CARRY THE BURDEN FOR THE LOST SOULS.


***Individually engaging with the Bible under the guidance of the Holy Spirit can assist individuals in building a solid foundation, ensuring they acquire a personal grasp of the truth. This footing can then shield them from falling easily for others' teachings, thereby upholding the truth for the succeeding generation.*** *[1 John 2:27](1 John 2:27)*.


***The One and Only worthy Pioneer, Author and Finisher of our faith, spiritual lives [Heb 12:2](Heb 12:2).*** 
*The Lord was showing me like a bright spotlight when we no longer see Jesus Christ as THE Pioneer and we all as His fellow spiritual pioneers along the Heavenly way He uniquely and personally leads us on from day one, then we are no longer on His way, since HE is the way; no other man is the way. Even as I write now, the nagging painful question in my soul is: “At what point saints did following the LORD become follow the Ministry?” And when did follow MINISTRY become the only way to follow the Lord. That’s when the MINISTRY became cultic.* (**Someone testimony**)



*Blessed is he that readeth, and they that hear the words of this prophecy, and keep those things which are written therein: for the time is at hand.* **[Revelation 1:3](Revelation 1:3)**


**4.**
The Church follows in the footsteps of Lord Jesus and the Apostles by extending help to those, in need just as mentioned in ***[John 13:29](John 13:29)*** and Acts of Assistance ***[Romans 15:25-26](Romans 15:25-26), [James 1:27](James 1:27)***. This showcases the Churchs nature as it attends to the needs of the fortunate particularly widows and widowers. The act of providing assistance is done with humility with the purpose of bringing honor to God the Father and our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ [1 Peter 1:3](1 Peter 1:3). 


**5.**
Anonymous Giving for Generous Hearts
A Guideline Inspired by our Lord Jesus's Teachings ***[Matthew 6:2-4](Matthew 6:2-4)***
As Lord Jesus said, *"When you give to the poor, don't let your left hand know what your right hand is doing."* When offering financial help to our fellow brethren within the Church, consider the example of placing the assistance in an envelope. Specify the recipient's name without indicating the source of the aid. This envelope can then be securely placed into the Offering Box.


**Serve GOD with HOLINESS and RIGHTEOUSNESS.**


These suggestions are not for newcomers to our gatherings; our desire is to ensure everyone feels equally embraced. Please remember, these are just suggestions, out of love for the **BODY OF CHRIST**."
