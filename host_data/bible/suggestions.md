**1.** Suggest for our experienced leaders to avoid much disco lights and to abstain from worldly-style concerts that emphasize emotional gratification (John 4:24). For our veteran sisters, let modesty guide their dress choices, favoring dresses that echo reverence. For our longstanding brothers, I suggest selecting attire that is more fitting than shorts, aligning with the occasion's importance (Romans 12:2).

**2.** 
Embrace Repentance, Confession, Forgiveness, and Cleansing before Presenting Yourself to the Lord (Matthew 5:23-24).

**3.**
Encouraging Inclusive Learning and Sharing
Let's let others share their opinions on topics like Bible study, meetings or fellowships, so that they can expand their knowledge and learn to convey the Good News to others as well. Let's teach them to learn and utilize the Lord's guidance in spreading the good news. Let's not allow only leaders or teachers to have the knowledge to proclaim the Good News of salvation. Invite others to read the Bible in order to have the knowledge to share the Good News (Colosas 3:16-17).

**4.**
Following the Footsteps of our Lord Jesus (Juan 13:29) and the Apostles in Acts of Assistance (Romans 15:25-26, James 1:27)
Church extending help to those in need, much like Lord Jesus and the Apostles did. It highlights the compassionate nature of the Church by addressing the needs of the less fortunate, particularly widows and widowers. The act of providing assistance is carried out with humility, with the sole intention of bringing glory to our Lord and Savior.

Anonymous Giving for Generous Hearts
A Guideline Inspired by our Lord Jesus's Teachings (Matthew 6:2-4)
As Lord Jesus said, "When you give to the poor, don't let your left hand know what your right hand is doing." When offering financial help to our fellow brethren within the Church, consider the example of placing the assistance in an envelope. Specify the recipient's name without indicating the source of the aid. This envelope can then be securely placed into the Offering Box.

**6.**
It is just a suggestion not to use titles like 'Rabbi' (Teacher), for we all have one Teacher, and we're all brothers and sisters (Matthew 23:8). When it comes to the gifts we possess, such as teaching, evangelism, and others (Ephesians 4:11), it might be worth considering treating them as Gifts, rather than making them a titles or professions (Mateo 20:27).

**7.**
Take Paul as an example; he worked diligently to support himself and to lessen the burden on the Church (Acts 20:34).
*And Absolutely, we should wholeheartedly support missionaries not only through financial means but also through fervent prayer (Colossians 4:2-4).*

**Serve GOD with HOLINESS and RIGHTEOUSNESS.**
