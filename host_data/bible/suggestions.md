**1.** Suggestions for our church leaders, it is good to minimize disco like lights in church gathering. For our veteran sisters, good suggestions are modesty apparel dress choices, favoring dresses that echo reverence. For our longstanding brothers, I suggest selecting attire that is more appropriate than shorts, aligning with the occasion's significance (1 Timothy 2:9-10), (Romans 12:2).

**2.** 
Embrace Repentance, Confession, Forgiveness, and Cleansing before Presenting Ourselves to the Lord (Matthew 5:23-24).

**3.**
3. Promote learning and sharing by allowing others to express their opinions on topics such, as Bible study, meetings or fellowships. This will enable them to expand their knowledge and effectively convey the Good News to others. Lets teach them how to seek and apply the guidance of the Lord when spreading the Good News; it shouldn't be limited to leaders or teachers who possess this knowledge. Encourage others to engage in reading the Bible so they can acquire the knowledge to share the Gospel (Colossians 3;16 17).

**4.**
The Church follows in the footsteps of Lord Jesus and the Apostles by extending help to those, in need just as mentioned in Juan 13;29 and Acts of Assistance (Romans 15;25 26 James 1;27). This showcases the Churchs nature as it attends to the needs of the fortunate particularly widows and widowers. The act of providing assistance is done with humility with the purpose of bringing honor to our Lord and Savior.

**5.**
Anonymous Giving for Generous Hearts
A Guideline Inspired by our Lord Jesus's Teachings (Matthew 6:2-4)
As Lord Jesus said, "When you give to the poor, don't let your left hand know what your right hand is doing." When offering financial help to our fellow brethren within the Church, consider the example of placing the assistance in an envelope. Specify the recipient's name without indicating the source of the aid. This envelope can then be securely placed into the Offering Box.

**Serve GOD with HOLINESS and RIGHTEOUSNESS.**
